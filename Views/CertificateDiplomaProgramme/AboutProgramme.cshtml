                                        This programme is for anyone who wants to learn French as it covers different levels based on the
                                        Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFRL); beginners to advanced
                                        ((levels from A1 to C2).
                                        This second stage is levels B1 and B2; the intermediate level.
                                        At the start of the programme, learners are expected to take a placement test so that their level will
                                        be determined and also take an exam at the end in order to be issued a certificate
                                    </p>

                                    <p><b>A. INTERMEDIATE I (B1)</b></p>
                                    <p><b>At this level, the learner is becoming an independent speaker of French.</b></p>
                                    <p>
                                        Level B1, which is sometimes referred to as ‘Threshold’ or ‘Breakthrough’ stage, is the point at
                                        which a French speaker moves away from the most simplistic language usage and is able to cope
                                        with most of the situations that they are likely to encounter when travelling around a Frenchspeaking country.
                                        In particular, a student at B1 level should be able to understand the key points from authentic
                                        speech, connect written phrases into simple text and start to communicate more complicated ideas.
                                        For example, they should be possible to describe events, experiences, expectations, ambitions and
                                        hopes, while also giving their own opinion

                                        one's own environment and use the appropriate social formulas, gestures, register and
                                        treatment in these situations

                                    </p> <p>
                                        • Encourage and diversify the use of strategies that streamline communication and facilitate

                                    </p> <p>
                                        • Manage tools to evaluate and improve one's own learning and use of the language
